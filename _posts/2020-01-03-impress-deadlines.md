> Your users don't care about a missed sprint. Hard deadlines are not user first, they are management first. Deadlines are good, they create a sense of urgency, bring predictability to your processes and for these reasons you should have them. But there are good deadlines and there are bad deadlines. There are companies where those deadlines are set in stone, and a missed deadline is next to fire. That's when the problem starts.
