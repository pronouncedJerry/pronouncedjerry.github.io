> Excellence is an outcome, so take note of when a prospect leans into a sales pitch, a project runs smoothly, or an angry customer suddenly calms down. Then turn to the team member who created the outcome and say, 'That! Yes, that!' By doing this, you’ll stop the flow of work for a moment and pull your colleague’s attention back toward something she just did that really worked.

\- Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall
